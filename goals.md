# Goals

1. Recommendation for items for a single user based on its buying history
2. Recommendation for items, not previously bought, for a single user based on its buying history and other simular users (Item-Item Collaborative Filtering)
3. Other users bought X also bought Y (Item-Item Collaborative Filtering)
4. Recommend similar (categorical) product (Content-Based)

# Scoring
Items can be ranked based on the frequency on which items are bought. An item that was bought 10 times has a 10 times higher score as a product that has been bought only once.
Feature scaling must be applied to level the scores.
